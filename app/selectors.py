"""Selector catalogue and resolution helpers.

Amazon ships DOM changes to the reports page without notice, so every element
is addressed by an ordered list of *candidate* selectors loaded from
``config/selectors.json``.  Fixing a broken run is then a config edit, not a
code change and redeploy.

A candidate may contain ``{placeholders}`` -- ``{label}``, ``{value}``,
``{name}`` -- filled in from ``params``, so one entry serves every dropdown on
the "New report" form instead of one entry per option.
