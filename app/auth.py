"""Automated Amazon sign-in.

AdProduct prefers a **reused session**: Chromium's persistent profile keeps the
advertiser signed in, and most runs never touch a login form at all.  This
module is the fallback for when that session is missing or has expired --
it fills in the configured credentials so a scheduled run can recover without
a human.

What :func:`sign_in` -- the unattended path -- will not do:

* It does not read, solve, or submit a CAPTCHA.
* It does not generate, guess or replay an OTP / MFA code.
* It does not disguise the browser or defeat bot detection.

When Amazon answers with any of those, sign-in stops with
:class:`AuthenticationError` and the run ends.  Those challenges exist to
confirm a human is present, and the correct response is to fetch one --
``python run.py --login``.

:func:`sign_in_interactive` is that response, for a server with no display.
It is the same form-filling, plus one thing: if Amazon asks for a two-step
code, it *asks the person running the command* to type it.  The boundary above
is unchanged -- the code still comes from the human and their registered
device, and a scheduled run can never reach this function.
